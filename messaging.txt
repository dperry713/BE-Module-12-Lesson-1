Task 1: Message Storage and Retrieval
To enhance the performance of message storage and retrieval, the primary considerations include efficient message ordering, low search complexity, and minimized storage overhead. Here’s an analysis of potential data structures:

Arrays:

Pros: Fixed-size arrays can be efficient for sequential storage, providing O(1) time complexity for index-based access.
Cons: Resizing arrays dynamically is costly in terms of performance, and inserting/deleting elements can take O(n) time. Not optimal for high-volume messaging.
Linked Lists:

Pros: Linked lists are flexible in size and allow for constant time O(1) insertion and deletion at the ends.
Cons: Searching for specific messages takes O(n) time, and linked lists have high overhead due to pointers.
Hash Tables:

Pros: Provide constant average-time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them suitable for quick retrieval.
Cons: Not inherently ordered, so additional data structures would be needed to maintain message order. Collisions could impact performance in high-volume scenarios.
Binary Search Trees (BST):

Pros: BSTs can store messages in sorted order and provide efficient search, insert, and delete operations with an average time complexity of O(log n).
Cons: BSTs become unbalanced with uneven insertions, resulting in O(n) operations. A self-balancing tree (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Tree) could solve this but adds complexity.
B-Trees:

Pros: B-Trees are designed for storage systems that handle large volumes of data efficiently, keeping message retrieval and insertion efficient even with high message volume.
Cons: Complexity in managing node splits and merges can make implementation more challenging. May be more efficient for disk-based storage rather than in-memory structures.
Recommendation: For in-memory management, a combination of hash tables (for quick message retrieval by message ID) and linked lists or BSTs (for ordered access) can balance retrieval speed and ordering. For persistent storage, B-Trees offer optimal performance with high message volume.

Task 2: Real-Time Updates
Real-time communication can be implemented using various techniques to minimize latency and maximize scalability.

Polling:

Pros: Polling is simple to implement and doesn’t require persistent connections.
Cons: Inefficient in terms of resource usage, as it constantly requests updates regardless of message arrival. Leads to high latency and server load.
Long-Polling:

Pros: Improves over standard polling by holding the request until there is a new message. Reduces unnecessary requests, leading to better resource usage than polling.
Cons: Still creates server strain, especially with many active users. Response delays can still occur, making it unsuitable for high-frequency updates.
WebSockets:

Pros: WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, enabling instantaneous message delivery. Highly efficient in resource use and latency
